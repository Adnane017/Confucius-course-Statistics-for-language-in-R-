## Description

I taught this four hour-long tutorial as part of the introduction to the empirical linguistics workshop, which was co-organised by the Confucius institute and the out of our minds group (University of Sheffield) in November 2017. It covers the basics of statistical data analysis in R. Although the tutorial uses an example from language research as its main case study, it will benefit any person who is looking to acquire basic skills in R for data analysis. The content of the tutorial was slightly modified post delivery to make it as a stand-alone public ressource.     

## Objectives

* Data manipulation
     - Reading data from different file formats. 
     - Various ways of extracting information from a data set in R.
* Data exploration
     - Calculating popular statistical measures to get a sense of the data (e.g. mean, variance and interquartile range) 
     - Exploring important relationships in the data using contingency tables
     - Representing the data using graphical tools like histograms, barplots and boxplots for a better understanding of the data
* Data modelling 
     - Running and interpreting basic statistical hypothesis tests
     - Performing logistic regression 
     - Evaluating and comparing different models.

## Necessary materials
     
The tutorial package contains a `pdf` handout that guides the learner through the tutorial, `Bresnan et al's (2007)` paper from which we extracted our examples, and an `R` script that contains the `R` code used in the tutorial as well as the answers to the questions that appear in the handout. The necessary data was obtained from the `languageR` package, which we call at the beginning of the `R` code. The following table summarises the contents of the tutorial package:

**Note:** The original handout that was given to the participants of the tutorial did not contain the outputs of the R commands to encourage the participants to test and interact with the commands. Also, the answers to the tutorial questions were not provided in the main R script.
